		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to my Github activity. These are my activity repositories in the last 90 days. I figured this would be a quick way to show some work as well as a fun way to show working with an API

		<h2>Web Projects</h2>
		<p>
			These are my projects alive and living on the web. By alive and living, I mainly mean they've been deployed to a server of some sort and I've actually purchased a domain for them (
			<em>or they're piggy-backing as a subdomain *cough-cough*</em>).
